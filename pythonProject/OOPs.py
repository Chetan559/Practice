# here w'll see object oriented programming in python
# class and object
# class is a blueprint for creating objects it defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have (silmillar to structure in c used for creating user defined data types)
# object is an instance of a class it is created from the class and has its own unique set of attributes and methods
#  lcasses allows you to create your own data type in python this is the primary feature of oop
#  it allows you to create your own data types and define their behavior

# to declre a class in python we use the keyword class followed by the name of the class and a colon

class Student1:
    #here we've created a class named Student1
    ...
    
class Student:    #here we've created a class named Student
    # ...  we can just leave a class with '...' notation if we don't want to define any attributes or methods in the class
    # classses comes with certian functions called methods
    # these methods are used to define the behavior of the class and its attributes
    def __init__(self, name, house, stable= None): # here we'he created dunctor of the class Student
        # the parameter self is given to the constructor to refer to the object itself
        # it is used to access the attributes and methods of the class

unlike java python doesn't have access modifiers like public, private, protected etc. but we can use _ to indicate that this is a private attribute of the class and it should not be accessed outside the class
it use the houner system to indicate that this is a private attribute of the class and it should not be accessed outside the class

wher the varible starts with _ it is considered as private and should not be accessed outside the class no one should touch it and __ indiactes more private than _
but it is not enforced by python it is just a convention and should be followed by the user of the class
